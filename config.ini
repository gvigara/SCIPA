###### SETUP AND QUALITY CONTROL SCRIPT ######

##Data normalization
#The function used is NormalizeData.
#First we need to determine the normalization method. By defect, it is Lognormalize but we have several:
#Lognormalize: feature counts for each cell divided by the total counts for that cell and multiplied by the scale factor
#CLR: applies a centered log ratio transformation
#RC: relative counts: same as log normalize but without the log transformation. 
Normalization_method = LogNormalize
#Set the scale factor for normalization (apply on LogNormalize)

#Choose the variable feature selection method (defect = vst)
